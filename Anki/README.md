# Anki Modules

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a flashcard program. I use it for Biblical languages study. This directory contains the Anki decks I have created.

Note these decks use a note type, GreekVocab which displays the data the way I like it. Also, note that I tend to use Cardo though I may switch to the Accordance font soon.

## Decks

  + ```Josephus Life.apkg```, all the words from Josephus' Life which do not appear in the NA 28 Greek New Testament. Built from the Accordance versions of these texts.
