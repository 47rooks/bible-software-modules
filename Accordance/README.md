##LukeHeb2Cor.zip and LukeHeb2CorNA.zip

  These are both reading plans and matching workspaces for reading Luke, Hebrews and 2 Corinthians in a year, actually in about 10 months. The NA file contains a workspace with the NA28 GNT text. The other uses the Ecumenical Patriarchal Text of the Greek Orthodox Church.
