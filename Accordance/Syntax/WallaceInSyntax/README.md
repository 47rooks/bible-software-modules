# Wallace's Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics Explored in Accordance Greek Syntax

These files are my collection of Accordance (Holmstedt-style) syntax queries and notes.
The workspaces can go anywhere you like. I personally put mine in a subdirectory of my ```Accordance Files``` directory called ```Wallace Syntax```.

The User Tool, ```Wallace Syntax Constructs.acc7``` should go into your ```User Tools``` directory under the ```Accordance Files``` directory. Note also that the User Tool has accord:// links to open the workspaces. These must be updated to work in your own Accordance environment if you wish to be able to open the workspaces by clicking on the link in the tool. You can of course alternatively just open them manually.
